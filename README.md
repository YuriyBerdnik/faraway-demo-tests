Dear,

Playwright new framework for me. I am excited to submit my solution for the end-to-end test automation framework assignment. It took me approximately 2-3 hours to complete this solution (Explore, deploy, configure, create tests). The primary challenge was ensuring the robustness and scalability of the framework, particularly in handling asynchronous actions and network interactions. I found the integration of GitHub Actions for CI/CD particularly interesting and rewarding, as it ensures a seamless and automated testing process.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Yury Berdnik
